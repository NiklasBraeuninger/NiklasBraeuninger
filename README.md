Hi there, I'm Niklas ðŸ‘‹
I'm a 23-year-old Business Informatics & Data Science student with a passion for the intersection of technology and business strategy.

Currently, I'm gaining practical experience in SAP consulting and project management at Schwarz IT. I am particularly interested in leveraging data to solve real-world business challenges and am always exploring new topics in the field of Machine Learning.
